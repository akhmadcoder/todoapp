## test assignment

Make a todo web application with backend and frontend.
use technologies:
- You can use any language for backend. 
- You can use Mysql or postgresq/MongoDB  etc.
- Use VueJs for frontend
- upload source code to github
- Comprehensive instruction how the app works and how to deploy it
- back end should only be a rest API and front end only uses the backend API

Features:
- Create/delete/update todo
- set todo to "Done"
- reorder tasks
- show dates when todo was created
- Simple UI

Nice to have:
- login functionality (no need for admin panel. It is enough to have some built in user)
- nested tasks. (Big task can have multiple sub-tasks)
- quick entry. A text field when a text is written and hit "Enter" a new task is created
- Anything you would like to add



## Please follow the steps below to deploy app to your (local) server

1.  open your terminal inside your servers root folder and run the following command below:
    git clone https://github.com/akhmadcoder/todoapp.git

2.  got to the app folder(which name is "todoapp"):
    cd todoapp  
    
3. create a new database 

4.  create ".env" file into root folder from ".env.exapmle" file and set up database DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD 

5. run "composer update" from your terminal from project root folder

6. run "php artisan migrate" command to migrate database tables

7. run "npm install" to install npm

8. run "npm update" to update npm

9. run "php artisan key:generate" to generate key

10. duplicate terminal window and run "npm run watch" command from first window and run "php artisan serve" from second window

11. Laravel development server will start ( like http://127.0.0.1:8000 ), so open that url from your browser to see the app

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
